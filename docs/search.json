    "text": "Shinya Yamanaka and the four factors that revolutionized stem cell biology\nI’m currently reading Why We Die by Venki Ramakrishnan, and it got me thinking about one particular type of cell that technically never dies; stem cells. Here’s a mind-bending fact: the stem cells in your body right now are the same stem cells your great-great-great-ancestors had centuries ago. They’ve been passed down through generations, living through thousands of years. In a way, they’re the most immortal part of us.\nBut what if I told you that in 2006, a scientist figured out how to turn back time? Not in a sci-fi movie way, but in the cells of living organisms. That scientist was Shinya Yamanaka, and his discovery was so revolutionary that it won him a Nobel Prize just six years later.\nToday’s paper: “Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors” (2006)\nOr as I like to call it: The Time Machine! ⏰"

    "text": "The Challenge: Can You Turn Back the Clock?\nHere’s the setup. Your body contains about 200 different types of cells—skin cells, muscle cells, nerve cells, and so on. They all started from the same place: embryonic stem (ES) cells. These magical ES cells are like the ultimate “blank slate” that can become anything. They’re pluripotent, meaning they have the potential to become any cell type in your body.\nBut here’s the catch: once a cell decides what it wants to be when it grows up (a skin cell, say), it’s committed. It’s like choosing your college major—except way more permanent. The cell’s identity gets locked in through complex genetic and chemical changes.\nThe big question: Could you take an adult cell that’s already made its life choices and somehow convince it to become young again? To go back to being a stem cell?"

Yamanaka started with 24 suspects, genes known to keep ES cells pluripotent.\n\nThe Investigation:\n\nRound 1: Tested each factor individually → Nothing worked; none of them alone could do the job.\nRound 2: Combined all 24 together → Boom! Got colonies that looked like ES cells\nRound 3: Removed factors one by one → Narrowed down to 10 essential ones\nRound 4: Further elimination → Identified THE FINAL FOUR suspects\n\nRemove any of these four, and you get nothing:\n\nOct3/4 – Master regulator of pluripotency\nSox2 – Oct3/4’s partner\nc-Myc – Powerful transcription factor (up to 25,000 genome binding sites!)\nKlf4 – Represses p53\n\nJust four factors to turn back the cellular clock. Nicknamed as the Yamanaka factors."

If truly pluripotent, they form a teratoma; a tumor with tissues from all three germ layers:\n\nEctoderm → nervous system, skin\nMesoderm → muscles, bones\nEndoderm → gut, lungs\n\nThe iPS cells passed! They could truly become any cell type."

    "text": "The Takeaway: Sometimes Simple is Revolutionary\nWhat makes this so beautiful is its simplicity. Not 24 factors. Not 10. Just four. Four transcription factors that could rewrite cellular identity and turn back developmental time. It’s a reminder that sometimes the most elegant solutions are hiding in plain sight, waiting for someone brave enough to test them systematically.\nYamanaka didn’t just discover a technique. He proved that cellular identity is far more flexible than we ever imagined. He showed us that the passage of time, at least at the cellular level, might not be as one-way as we thought.\nEvery groundbreaking discovery starts with someone’s “what if?”\n\n\nReferences\n\nTakahashi, K., & Yamanaka, S.

How do the players identify their teammates? Yes, one answer is their team colour! When they see the team colours, they know it’s their teammate, pass the ball, and trust that they’ll score a goal!\nNow, how do they know what colour their team is? Obviously, before the game, they see the colours and remember: this is our guy. Well, something similar also happens in our body. Have you ever wondered how our immune cells don’t attack our own cells? Is it because, during early development, they are exposed to self-cells, much like players seeing their team colours before the match? This was exactly the question asked by the British biologist Peter Medawar and his colleagues."

He doesn’t learn this during the match; rather, he already knows: Blue = Teammate But what if you trick him? If you tell him his team is Red during the pre-match talk, but his friends walk out in Blue, he’ll treat his own teammates like invaders. He’ll tackle them, intercept their passes, and yes, Hala Madrid!"

Early exposure- live strain A cells were injected during very early development, either late in embryonic life or within the first 24 to 48 hours after birth, when the immune system is still immature.\nIn another group, the same cells were injected later in life, after the immune system had matured."

They observed that strain B mice exposed to strain A cells during early development accepted the skin graft, whereas those exposed later in life rejected it. Importantly, these tolerant mice still rejected skin grafts from unrelated third-party strains, showing that the immune system was not generally suppressed."

Exposure to cells early in development teaches the immune system which cells belong to the body, just as a football player learns the team colours before the match. Early-exposed cells are treated as “self,” while new, unfamiliar cells are recognised as outsiders and rejected.\n“Indeed, first impressions truly do matter!”\nWhat our bodies see early on shapes how they respond for life, teaching the immune system to distinguish friend from foe, a lesson in recognition, memory, and trust that lasts a lifetime. So the next time you play, remember, your body’s team was chosen long before you even kicked a ball.\n\n\nReferences\n\nBillingham, R. E., Brent, L., & Medawar, P. B. (1953).

Bacterial viruses kept killing their yogurt cultures, ruining entire batches.\nWhat they discovered was astonishing: bacteria had a memory system. When a virus attacked, the bacteria would grab a piece of the virus’s DNA and store it in their own genome – like keeping a “wanted poster”. These stored fragments were arranged in a peculiar pattern: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats – CRISPR.\nIf the same virus attacked again, the bacteria would recognize it and destroy it. It was adaptive immunity at the bacterial level. But nobody imagined this bacterial immune system could become the most powerful genome editing tool in history."

Expensive. Time-consuming. Like building new scissors from scratch every time you wanted to cut a different thread.\nEnter Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier.\nThey figured out exactly how the bacterial CRISPR system worked – and how to weaponize it for genome editing.\n\nThe Key Components:\n\nCas9 – The protein that cuts DNA (the scissors)\ncrRNA – Contains the “target address” (20 bases that match your target DNA)\ntracrRNA – Activates Cas9 and helps it work\nPAM sequence – A “NGG” DNA motif next to the target (like a safety lock)\n\nThe DNA only cuts when all four are present: Cas9 + crRNA + tracrRNA + Magnesium.\nThe game-changer? They showed you could combine crRNA and tracrRNA into one engineered guide RNA to direct Cas9 to cut any DNA sequence you wanted. They tested five different guide RNAs targeting five different sequences. All worked perfectly.\nThis paper is from 2012, and if you look at the figures, they’re filled with gel electrophoresis photos.
